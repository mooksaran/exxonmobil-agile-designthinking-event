🔍 Overview

This project documents the end-to-end design and execution of a real-world Agile Culture event co-organized with ExxonMobil. The goal was to introduce university students to Agile working principles, internship pathways, and cross-functional team roles within global organizations like ExxonMobil.

The project applied Stanford's Design Thinking framework:
1. Empathize  
2. Define  
3. Ideate  
4. Prototype  
5. Test & Reflect

This repository hosts presentation materials, planning documents, visual feedback, and takeaways from the workshop.

🧠 Design Thinking Phases

1. Empathy
- Target: 3rd–4th year students from Business, Engineering, and IT faculties
- Pre-event surveys and informal interviews highlighted pain points:
  - Uncertainty about internship application processes
  - Misconceptions about Agile frameworks
  - Lack of real-world exposure to company culture

2. Define
- Key challenges:
  - Students struggle to connect coursework with job roles
  - Agile remains abstract without workplace context
  - Students are unsure how to prepare or apply for global internships

3. Ideate
- Brainstormed workshop formats that promote interaction
- Final agenda included:
  - 2 expert guest speakers (Agile Coach + HR)
  - Real-world Agile walkthroughs
  - Internship Q&A
  - Live student reflections

4. Prototype & Execution
- Developed poster and announcement strategy (LINE + Facebook groups)
- Event hosted on Microsoft Teams
- Attendance reached 58 people (51 students + 7 speakers/staff)

5. Test & Feedback
- 48 feedback responses collected post-event via Google Form
- Engagement peaked during internship Q&A
- Participants praised the clarity of Agile topics and speakers’ insights
- Suggestions included earlier advertising and aligned survey formats

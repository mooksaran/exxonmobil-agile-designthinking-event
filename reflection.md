## 🔧 What Could Be Improved

- 📆 The poster was released too close to the event (less than 1 week), which limited broader outreach.
- 🗓 The event time clashed with a BBA exam and other university activities.
- 🗂 Two different survey sets (speaker and internal) created confusion among the audience.
- 📢 Students suggested more advance notice and additional sessions in Thai for non-English speakers.

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- Real company stories resonate better than theory alone.
- Advertising timeline and platform diversity are crucial to engagement.
- Partnering with HR and engineers gives both technical and career perspectives.
- Reflection and feedback are valuable tools to iterate and improve event design.
